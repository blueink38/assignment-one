        </div>
        <div class="benefits-title">
            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt=""/>

                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.

        </div>
        <div class="benefits-title">
            <h3>Cost Management</h3>

                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Accessibility
    - added ADA conforming descriptions to images
    - semantic tags were added to both the HTML and CSS codes to improve readablity
* Consolidation
    - removed redunancy in the HTML and CSS codes while maintaining full functionality of the site
    - reordered the HTML and CSS codes so they mirror each other and thus improve their flow
* Functionality
    - fixed links in the page to improve flow

To-do list:
* Optimize for mobile viewing
* Perhaps add some animation in the future

## Status
